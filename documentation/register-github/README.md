# How to: register with GitHub

## Introduction
This short tutorial will guide you through the steps necessary to register with GitHub in order to view the project files.

## What is GitHub?
[GitHub](https://github.com/) is an online code repository and versioning system widely used in software development. It essentially means that all the code and data necessary for the *Bee Book* can be securely stored, accessed and, if necessary, rolled back to their previous versions. In the specific case of the *Bee Book*, GitHub is also the host for the website, meaning that any changes to its content can be made by simply changing (or creating) new files in the website's repository.

A fuller explanation of how GitHub works is outside the scope of this guide, but there are plenty of resources available online if you want to find out more.
