*Bee-ing Human* is an interdisciplinary research project gathering researchers and practitioners from literary studies, musicology, digital humanities and biology (animal behaviour). It centres on a seventeenth-century apiculture book, Charles Butler's *The Feminine Monarchy of Bees*, using it both as an object of study and as a departure point to contrast the early modern knowledge and culture around bees and beekeeping with the latest research in animal behaviour and emotion. Literary scholars will study and edit Butler's original text, musicologists will study the compositions included in Butler's writing, as well as respond with new compositions and reinterpretations of the sound of bees and research results; biologists, inspired by Butler's work, will work on the emotional states of bees. Alongside this disciplinary research, we will record, document, and present our own interdisciplinary process, as bees with different roles working together for the good of the colony.

The RSE is responsible for creating the final output (the digital hub that will become the new bee book) that will gather all the material and research produced during the project, digital experiments to communicate the research methods employed by the different disciplines, as well as coordinate and oversee the digital editing component of the project.
