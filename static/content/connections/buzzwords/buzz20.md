The biggest challenge in designing the **buzzword** system (in addition to the many technical challenges of creating filtering and searching options), was to create a system that would be able to balance the (mostly static, long-term and cost-efficient) technology with ease of use. It is crucial that everyone in the team is capable of adding **buzzwords** at any time, at will; but doing so in a user-friendly manner without using expensive content management systems is tricky. The solution we have now -- github based, markdown files -- is not perfect, but it will hopefully be easy enough for everyone. Only time will tell.
