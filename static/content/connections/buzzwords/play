>*Sometimes as well in Summer as Winter the Bees take pleasure to play abroad before the Hive, specially those that are in good plight, flying in and out, and about, so thicke, and so earnestly, as if they were swarming or fighting: when indeed it is onely to solace themselves:*<  
At the end of chapter one, Butler writes about the bees playing for pleasure and gives us the emotion-adjacent word 'solace.' The Oxford English Dictionary shows that the grammar of this word (which indicates comfort, consolation, entertainment, or recreation) can balance on the flow of energy between oneself and the world: you can give solace to others, give solace to yourself, or take solace. Here it means that the bees entertain themselves, though to what extent this is themselves individually or in a group dynamic is ambiguous.   
The punctuation mimics this play with its commas, which let us feel the pace of the bees' flight and give us a sense of their movement. In the 1609 edition the following paragraph, the last in the chapter, is typeset in a playful pyramid shape.
