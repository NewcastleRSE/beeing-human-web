                    later part of which saying, although the delicate Silk-worme have in some hoter
                    Climates disproved; (for in the colder countries, such as is our Iland of <placeName

                    and therefore is here to be entertained only of them, that doe more respect
                    their pleasure, than their profit; and doe content themselves with the beholding
                    of their queint worke, not expecting any further recompence for their expence
                    and paines;) yet must shee needs confesse the former, and wheresoever she meet
                    the ingenuous and laborious Bee, yeeld the precendence to her, as to hir Better.
                    For the fruite of the Silk-worme serveth onlie to cover the body; but the fruit
                    of the Bees to nourish and cure it: that is to be applied outwardly, this to be
                    inwardly received: that for comlinesse and conveniency, this for health and
                    necessity. But, to omit comparison, the worke and fruit of the little Bee is so

                    , <persName>Palladius</persName>, <persName>Averroes</persName>. Yea the learned

                        Ambrose</persName>, and <persName>Isidore</persName> have thought it a
                    subject fit for their penns. Unto which I may adde infinite others of later
                    times both in Latine and English.</p>
                <p>But the many yeeres experiments &amp; observations, which those great Bee-masters <persName>

                    posterity; Time, ah injurious Time, hath buried in oblivion. And for the rest
                    that are extant, they seeme unto me to rely more upon the relation of others,
                    than any certaine knowledge of their owne. Notwithstanding them are scattered in

                    for ornament and authoritie inserted. But the later Writers, imitating the
                    ancient where they thought good, chusing some of their directions and refusing

                    hinderances, that I might know how to doe good unto them, which are so good for
                    us, and what is the due and right ordering of these delightful, profitable, and
                    necessary creatures. And having to my contentment, though to my cost, in some
                    sort obtained my desire, I was incited, even by the rule of charitie, to
                    communicate that to my neighbours and country-men, which I have found so

                    direct you. For example, if you would know the Spleeting of Hives, or the manner
                    of Hiving Bees; looking into the <ref target="#" rend="italic">Index</ref> of
                    the Chapters, you shall perceive the one to appertaine to the Third, and the
                    other to the Fifth; and running over the Contents of either Chapter, you shall
                    find the first to be the Tenth note, and the other the 53. Then turning to these
                    Marginall Notes in the said Chapters, you have in the Text over against them

                        type="authorial" subtype="summary">8. <hi>A memorable experiment</hi>.</note>
                    Two swarmes being put together, the Bees on both sides, as their manner is, made
                    a murmuring noise, as being discontented with the suddain congresse of
                    Strangers: but knowing wel that the more the merrier, the safer, the warmer,
                    yea, and the better provided; they were quickly made friends. And having agreed
                    which Queene should reigne, and which should die, three or foure Bees brought
                    one of them downe betweene them, pulling and haling her as if they were leading
                    her to execution: which I by chance perceiving, got hold of her by the wings,
                    and with much adoe <fw type="catch"> tooke</fw>

                    </fw>
                    tooke her from them. After a while (to see what would come of it) I put her into
                    the Hive againe: no sooner was she among them, but the tumult began afresh,
                    greater then before, and presently they fell together by the eares, fiercely
                    fighting and killing one another, for the space of more than an houre together:
                    and by no meanes would cease, untill the poore condemned Queene was brought
                    forth slaine and laid before the doore. Which done, the strife presently ended,
                    and the Bees agreed well together. </p>
                <p>Somtime when one swarme is put to another, though they do not fight, yet will
                    they not agree of their choice in two or three daies, keeping their Queenes
                    close on both sides. But then all this while they never be at quiet day nor
                    night, nor once offer to work, untill one of them being deposed, they be united
                    in the other. <bibl>Vide

                <p>Likewise if the old Queene bring forth many Princes (as she may have six or
                    seven, yea sometime halfe a score or more, which superfluitie nature affoordeth

                    should distract the unstable Commons into factions, within two daies after the
                    last swarme, yea sometime (when unkinde weather keepeth him in over long) even
                    before he come forth, you shall finde the superfluous Princes dead before the

                    presence, or to come among them being troubled, it is better to stand upon your
                    guard, then to trust to their gentlenesse. For the safeguard of your face (which
                    they have most mind unto) provide a purs-hood made of course boultering, to be
                    drawn and knit about your collar: which, for more safetie, is to bee lined
                    against the eminent parts with Woollen-cloth. First, cut a peece about an inch
                    and a halfe broad, and halfe a yard long, to reach round by the temples and
                    fore-head from one eare to the other: which being sowed in his place, joyne unto
                    it two short peeces of the same bredth under the eyes, for the balls of the
                    cheekes: and then for another peece about the bredth of a shilling against the
                    top of the nose. In stead of this, you may use a Cypres Band or a Boulter,
                    having a Handkerchiefe betweene your fore-head and it, to beare it out from the
                    skinne, and your hat on your head to hold it fast. And if they be so earnest
                    that you feare stinging your hands, put on a paire of woollen cuffes or gloves.
                    When you have on this Helmet and Gantlets, as a man armed at all points, you may

                    Unto Cattel which have not the reason by flight or otherwise to save themselves
                    they are more dangerous. A Horse in the heat of the day looking over a hedge, on
                    the other side whereof was a stall of Bees, while hee stood nodding with his
                    head, as his manner is, because of the Flies, the Bees fell upon him and killed
                    him. Likewise, I heard of a Teeme that stretching against a hedge, overthrew a
                    stalle on the other side, and so two of the Horses were stung to death. I doubt

                    and skilfull, as not only to descrie a certaine little God a mightie, though he
                    came
                    among them in likenesse of a Wafer-cake; but also to build him an artificiall
                    Chappell. If I should relate the Storie, all men, I know, would not beleeve it:
                    notwithstanding, because every man may make some use of it, you shall have it. </p>

                    knowledge and devotion of Bees.</hi></note> A certain simple woman having some
                    stals of Bees which yeelded not unto hir desired profit, but did consume and die
                    of the murraine; made her mone to another Woman more simple then hir selfe: who
                    have her counsell to get a consecrated Host, and put it among them. According to
                    whose advice she went to the Priest to receive the Host: which when she had
                    done, she kept it in her mouth, and being come home againe she tooke it out, and
                    put it into one of hir Hives. Whereupon the murraine ceased, and the Honie
                    abounded. The Woman therefore lifting up the Hive at the due time to take out
                    the Honie, saw there (most strange to be seene) a Chappell built by the Bees,
                    with an altar in it, the wals adorned by marvellous skill of Architecture, with
                    windowes conveniently set in their places: also a doore and a steeple with
                    bells. And the Host being laid upon the altar, the Bees making a sweet noise,
                    flew round about it. </p>
                <p>But whether this doe more argue the supernaturall knowledge and skill of the
                    Bees, or the miraculous power of the Host, or the spirituall craftinesse of him,
                    whose comming is by the working of Satan with all power and signes and lying

                    may make a question: and presuming to examin every particular circumstance over
                    narrowly, will make objections against the truth of the Storie: which, by their
                    leaves, in the behalfe of my Author, I must not spare to answer. First, it may
                    be they will object that the Host being held so long in the Womans mouth, could
                    not choose in that space but melt and marre. <fw type="catch"> Indeed,</fw>
                    <pb
                        n="D1r" />
                    <fw type="header">
                        <hi>and of their Queene.</hi>
                    </fw> Indeed, if it did
                    remaine, as it was, a Wafer-cake, this were likely enough: but being turned into
                    flesh, the case is altered. If they shall say that because it was now
                    Honie-harvest, at which time good stals, such as this was, are full of Wax and
                    Honie, that therefore there could not be roome enough for a Chappell with a
                    steeple and bells in it; I answer, that this is as weake and simple as the
                    former. For seeing it is knowne that a Blacke-smith of <placeName>London</placeName>
                    did make a Locke and a Key so little that a flye could draw it; why should not
                    the little Smith of <placeName>
                        Nottingham</placeName>, which doth the worke that no man can, frame a little
                    Chappell in a litle roome? But then perhaps they will reply, if wee grant you
                    this, yet how could the Bees flie about the altar in that little Chappell,
                    seeing they are scarce able flie in so narrow a close roome as the emptie hive?
                    As for that, it may be a mistaking of a word: haply the woman said they did but
                    crawle. If they shall aske how the woman could see the altar with the Host
                    standing in the Chancell, and the Bells hanging in the steeple, seeing the waxen
                    walls were not transparent, they maie easily thinke that the Bees would give
                    their dame leave to looke in at the windowes. And if they shall say that those
                    bells being made of such metall would give but a weake sounde, when they were
                    rung to Mattins; they must consider the Parishoners dwelt not farre off. And so
                    I thinke these captious Criticks will hold themselves satisfied. </p>
                <p>Unto this Storie my Author immediately addeth an other, like unto it, and as
                    likely: how certaine Theeves having stollen the Silver Box wherein the
                    Wafer-Gods use to lye, and finding one of them there, being loth, belike, that
                    hee should lye abroad all night, did not cast him away, but laid him under a
                    Hive: whom the Bees acknowledging, advanced to an high roome in the Hive, and
                    there in stead of his silver boxe, made him another of the whitest Waxe: and
                    when they had so done, in worship of him, at set houres they sung most sweetly
                    beyond all measure about it: yea the owner tooke them at it at midnight, with a
                    light and all. Wherewith the Bishop being made acquainted, came thither with
                    many others: and lifting up the Hive he saw there <fw type="catch"> neere</fw>
                    <pb

                    neere the top a most fine box, wherein the Host was laid, and the Quires of Bees
                    singing about it, and keeping watch in the night, as Monkes do in their
                    Cloisters. The Bishop therefore taking the Host carried it with the greatest
                    honour into the Church: whither many resorting, were cured of innumerable
                    diseases. </p>
                <p>I doubt not, but some incredulous people wil quarrell this Storie as well as the
                    former: making question, since the combs in the top of the Hive, are not past
                    halfe
                    an inch one from an other, how there could be roome for a boxe of that bredth
                    that
                    would containe the Host; and then being there, how it might be seene by the
                    Bishop,
                    seeing those spaces are alwaies filled with Bees, and the Storie saith, that
                    they
                    were then singing about it: and therefore perhaps they will suspect the whole
                    Narration, supposing it rather to be an unadvised device of some idle Monke,
                    which,
                    if he had consulted with them that have skill among Bees, might have made his
                    tale
                    more probable. Alledging moreover, that therefore there is no mention made of my
                    particular person, time, or place, lest the circumstances should disprove the
                    matter
                    it selfe. All which objections I could as easily answer as the former, if I
                    thought
                    it needfull; But now because some may be as ready to mistrust my relation, as
                    others
                    are to object against the truth of the Stories; I will here in mine owne behalfe
                    for
                    their satisfaction, set downe in my Authors owne words. </p>

                            alvearis videt
                            apes certis horis sæpius, dimissis operis ad cibos convehendos, totes
                    esse in
                            quodam mellifluo concentu edendo. Cumque, fortè de media nocte
                    exsurrexisset,
                            conspicatur supra alveare illustrissimam lucem, suavissemeque, præter
                    omnem
                            modum modulantes apes. Rei novitate inusitatâ, &amp; prorsus admirandâ
                    perculsus, Deique monitu intimo agitatus rem defert ad Episcopum. Is plurimis
                    secum assumptis eo se conferens, aperto alveari videt Vasculum elegantissimum
                    effectum è candidissima cera prope alvearis fatigium, in quo reposita erat
                    Eucharistia, circa illud choros apum circumsonantes, &amp; excubias agentes.
                    Acceptum igitur Episcopus sacramentum maximo cum honore in templum reportavit:

                <p>In which Storie wee may note, besides the wonderfull knowledge and devotion of

                    the strongest straw, and lay it in soake about a quarter of an houre. Being thus
                    prepared, take out of that wet bundle a litche of 40. or 50. reedes or strawes;
                    and laying halfe of them one way, and halfe the other, that the band may be of

                    with the middle reeds of the Head, and twisting them fast together in your hand,
                    let the band harle or double in the very top of the Head: and so begin to binde
                    the Head round, working downeward, and still twisting the band as you goe. When
                    that litche is well-nigh wrought up, take out of the wet bundle so many more

                    end of the first litche, holding them in your hand twist them fast together: and
                    so continue your worke, alwaies binding as hard as you can, &amp; bearing up
                    every roule close to his fellow. When you are come down to the string, loose it,

                    bodies, they breed also two other sorts, Drones or Male-waspes (which are
                    somewhat bigger and longer than the small Waspes, and without stings as the
                    Drone-bees) and Mother-Waspes, which are like the small ones in all respects
                    save that they are twice so bigge. These when they are fledge having conceived,

                    abroad (as their Drones also doe) gathering information for themselves, and
                    searching and prying into every corner as they goe, for their Winter-lodging:
                    and after a while, when the aire waxeth cold, leaving both Drones and small

                    adjoyning to Woods their neasts will be most rife) where they abide till the
                    next spring without any meat, as it were in a dead sleepe: out of the which
                    neverthelesse a little warmth of the fire, or of your hand will awake them at
                    any time. At the blowing of Palme, if the weather be warme, they flie abroad for
                    food: and in <term>

                    The Dorre likewise beginneth hir neast single, being more like the Bee then the
                    Waspe is, in that she maketh Honie, and more unlike in the fashion of hir Combs:
                    for she hath only a few round cels of the bignesse of grapes, lying flat on the
                    ground one upon another without any order: the which are made after this manner.
                    First either upon the ground in the grasse, or in some shallow hole within the
                    ground, shee prepareth a little stuffe which is soft like Wax, but browne and
                    more brittle, of the bignesse of hir head; and therein she layeth about six or
                    seaven seedes together, compassing them round with the same stuffe: which
                    increaseth by little and little as the seedes doe: and when they begin to live,
                    it groweth into so many severall Cells, as there are grubs, each one having one
                    to himselfe. When they become to their bignesse, the Cells, which before were
                    browne and brittle, doe now wax white and tough, that you can scarce teare them.
                    And when the Dorres are ripe, they gnaw their way out at the top. Upon these
                    they make more in like manner, and the void open Cells they fill with Honie,
                    wherewith they feed both themselves and their young, when the weather suffreth
                    them not to flie abroad. All this neast is covered with a little Mosse like a
                    Birds-neast. Untill <term>Leo</term> they breed females onely as the Waspes doe:
                    and then last of all, for propagation of their kind, they breed their Drones,
                    being likewise, as the Drones of Bees and Waspes, without stings. And these, to
                    put the matter out of doubt, within a moneth after when they are ripe, doe
                    openly engender with their females, as the chaffers doe, but their mates they
                    choose in the neast, and are carried away by them. After which time the females
                    breed no more till the next Summer, <fw type="catch"> though</fw>

                    if they have once begun a combe without where they lie, the matter is out of

                    make ready also two square stickes 13. or 14. inches long; and an inch thicke at
                    one end, and halfe an inch at the other: these two <fw type="catch"> sticks</fw>

                    </fw> sticks lay
                    parallel over the hive five or six inches apart, and each of them a like
                    distance from the middle of the Hive, with both the thicke ends one way to size
                    out the doore for this doubled stall: and so tie them with needle and thread to
                    the skirts fast in their places. These stickes doe also serve to keepe the Hive
                    from slipping, and so save the Bees, that otherwise might be prest to death
                    betweene the two skirts. Then in a faire night, so soon as it is dark, reare the
                    full Hive with three bolsters, two on the West side, and one on the East, some
                    foure or five inches high, (or with a double rest) to let the Bees in: and cover
                    both it and the stoole with a large Mantle. <note type="authorial"

                    wisp of straw, it may fitly receive the top of the Hive, and so the Hive may
                    stand upright and fast in the Brake. Then pare away the inner edges of the tops

                        that weigheth foure, and a very good one that weigheth six. Hereby also it

                        quantity of two reasonable swarmes united: there being also few single
                        swarms so good, as to amount to 30000.</p>

                <p>If this just proportion be not precisely kept, the Bees may doe well enough in a

                    though

                    though they spend some time in supplying the former yeeres defects, they may yet
                    swarme in good time, and the fairer swarme. And indeed all swarmes, whether
                    bigger
                    or lesse, by decreasing or increasing, doe naturally draw towards this quantity. </p>

                    shake the Bees into the Hive: and when you have set the Hive right upon the

                    that they may see each other; let the greatest part alone, specially if it bee
                    best to hive, and trouble the other in the setling with shaking, gentle rubbing
                    with weeds, and spitting and blowing in the place, that they may goe to their
                    fellowes. If they bee setled and hang upon a bough, cut the bough and bring them
                    to them. If they bee setled in some other place, then put them in a hive without

                        <hi>Of the Swarming of Bees,</hi>
                    </fw> I had espied
                    about a handfull of Bees hanging upon a Nettle on the ground: among which was
                    the Prince. When I had cut off the Nettle, and set it by the Rest under the
                    Hives-kirt; presently the knot unknitting, I saw the lost Prince with hir long
                    traine stately walking into the Hive. As soone as shee was entred, these
                    Male-contents began to stand still and buzze, joyfully shaking their wings, as
                    they wont to doe when they are pleased; and so quietly kept the Hive. To see the
                    suddaine alteration among them presently upon hir approach, and how they could
                    have notice of it all at once, as well they without, as those within, would even
                    make a man to wonder; but that indeed all they doe is nothing else but wonders. </p>

                    Swarmes that goe home, doe sometimes stay long before they rise againe: and when
                    they rise (specially if they were hived) they are likely to fly away: although I
                    have knowne a swarme to rise foure times in three daies, and at the last to be
                    quietly hived. If therefore you perceive the swarme returning before many be
                    entred the old stocke, shut the doore fast: if that will not serve the turne,
                    carrie the old stocke away stoole and all, and set the swarme presently upon a
                    stoole in his place. </p>

                <p>For proofe of the other, The new swarmes within one weeke, if the weather serve

                    shall you scarce see one carry any of this. If you would know the reason why the
                    stocks gather so much, and the new swarmes so little; it is because the stockes
                    have <term>schadons</term> which they feed with it, and the new swarmes have

                    starves the Bees. Some enter by the doore, or by some open place in the skirts
                    of the Hive: some gnaw a hole throrow in the top of the Hive, where they know
                    the Honie lieth: some keepe their old homes, and come to the Hive onely for
                    their baits: some make their nests betweene the Hackle and the Hive, that they

                    whole, and give the Grubs to your Chicken: although the Boyes make better sport
                    in burning them. But if you be in haste, and care onely to dispatch them quickly
                    and quietly, thus doe. First, stop their way close; that they within breake not
                    out upon you (for those that are abroad comming home wearie and loaded are more
                    gentle.) Then presently with a <ref target="#ch7glon3">*</ref> Waspe-spade
                    search for the Nest: which, if it be shallow, is quickly found. When you have
                    found it (which you shall know by the easie entrance of the Spade) then dig
                    downe round about it: and having thus rounded the Nest, stamp the earth downe
                    upon the Combes, and so have you done. If you finde not the Nest because it
                    lyeth <ref target="#ch7glon4">†</ref> deepe; then dig up the ground a foot about
                    the hoale; and having found their way, stop it fast with earth, and tread in
                    that you digged out, and let them alone. If this be done in the day when many
                    are abroad; the evening or morning following you may kill them with your foot:
                    but in the evening you may take them all together. </p>

                    robbing. Likewise those Bees that are offended with the blacknesse and
                    rottennesse of their Combes, caused through age, or wet, or with abundance of
                    noisome stopping; will most of them goe forth in the swarmes, leaving a very
                    few, sometime not past a handfull, in the stocke: which yet in robbing-time will
                    keep the doore, as though the Hive were full: but the Robbers finding their

                    This also I have noted, that when the robbers are so few, that smal resistance
                    will serve; yet being called forth they will not bee idle: for you shall see
                    some of them running up and downe about the Hive, to seeke and search if any
                    more come: others, like trained Souldiers, practising to fight: here one
                    wrestling with another in single combat: there two, or three, or foure setting
                    against one; as their usuall manner is to deale with the theeves. If you would
                    know whether this fight bee in jest or earnest, with fellowes or with foes; the
                    manner, and the end thereof will shew you. For if they bee fellowes, their fight
                    is not so fierce, and they wil part quietly as friends: whereas if they be foes,
                    though they scape, it shall bee with much adoe. For if the true men cannot kill
                    the theeves; yet will they hold them by the legs or by the wings so long as they
                    can, in hope to have helpe, though <fw type="catch"> they</fw>

                    to smell all alike, so that the true men cannot knowe the Theeves from their
                    fellowes: and therefore some use to do so, when two swarmes are put together,
                    that they may seeme to be of one companie. If these usual helps be no helps,
                    what help is there then? If you perceive their fighting in time before any great
                    harme be done, then this must you doe. First stop them up close that none can
                    passe either in or out, leaving onely a breathing place. Then shal you have a
                    double conflict; one within, an other without. The theeves that are within,
                    having no way to escape with their preyes, first or last will be slaine all.
                    They that are without, after a little wrestling, seeing nothing to be had but
                    blowes, will not long abide this bootlesse danger. When you perceive the siege
                    to be raised, and that there is little or no fighting without; (which will be
                    about an houre after) then may you let out your Bees, making the doore halfe an
                    inch high, and scarce halfe an inch wide. Those few that were within will they
                    bring forth to buriall; some then, some on the morrow. In the evening, when the
                    Bees are all in, shut them up as before. The next day betimes, before the Bees
                    would be abroad, must you looke for some of them againe. When they are come,
                    beat them away with a bough, but kill them not: for so may you do your neighbour
                    a shrewd turne, and your selfe too. </p>
                <p>But let not the Bees out before noone: and then make the doore so narrow, that

                    manner of feeding Bees in their Hives is divers. Some give them Honie in a
                    spoone: but that way many of them be-smeare their wings: and if their fellowes
                    licke them not cleane presently, before the cold chill them, they die. Others,
                    to avoid this inconvenience, give it them in a warme Toste: but this way wasteth
                    the hony, &amp; doth not altogether avoid the former inconvenience. Others have
                    other devices. But indeed the only good way to feed Bees is with a combe, after
                    this manner. First, take a fresh Combe of Live-honie out of a Hive, &amp; lay it
                    upon some Prop or stay, that the Bees may worke, as well under as upon. This
                    Prop may be a woodden grate seven or eight inches square, made of two sides
                    halfe an inch deepe, and three ribs fastened into them with Dove-railes, or with
                    small nailes. For a need two severall square stickes may serve: but then you
                    cannot so quickly either see it in, or take it out. </p>
                <p>Then in a faire calme evening (when the heat of the day, and the Bees worke is
                    past) place this upon the stoole: so that the Feeding-combe be reared as neere
                    the Hive-combes as may be, not touching them, lest the Bees fasten this and them
                    together. Then see that the Hive, set downe in his place, be close every where:
                    and at the doore but room enough for a Bee or two to passe. Then will these Bees
                    to worke afresh, not ceasing day nor night untill they have rid the Combe
                    cleane: which within eight and fortie houres will be effected. If they need any
                    more, the next evening doe <fw type="catch"> likewise.</fw>

                    Remove alwaies in a faire day, and, as neere as you can guesse, in setled
                    weather. For when they are moved to another place, if it be within their circuit
                    or walke; they will flie to their old standing as soone as they are let goe, and
                    hanker about it three or foure daies, and sometime longer: where if the cold wet
                    catch them, many lose their lives. And if you remove them out of their
                    knowledge, then, as amazed in an uncouth place, they flie about for a while
                    viewing the countrie, and searching for their old home: when they are wearie,
                    they rest wheresoever: and if foule weather come upon them, they are in like

                        For they will surely die. Neither is it safe to trust any after they have
                        stoode five yeeres: unlesse it be some speciall kinde of Bees, which cast
                        often, and yet beating away their Drones betimes, doe still keepe themselves
                        in heart. For such I have kept nine or ten yeeres: and I have heard of some
                        of a greater age. Moreover, all stalls of three yeeres old and upward, that
                        have mist swarming two yeeres together: and especially those, that having
                        lyen forth the summer before, did not cast this last summer: for such doe
                        seldome after prosper. It is therefore better to take them now while they
                        are good, than in a vaine hope of increase, to keep them till they perish.

                        yeeres some will be, even down to the Stoole) those are ripe and ready to
                        yeeld their fruit. One such is worth three or foure. Take them therefore in
                        their season: For wanting roome to breed in (their Cells being full of
                        Honie) they will decay by little and little, and consume to nothing. And
                        therefore, as in a wet hungry yeere you must keepe the best, so in a drie
                        yeere, rich and plentifull in Honie-dewes, the worst are like to prove best
                        for store. </p>

                        being taken off with a spoone, put to the second part. In cold weather the

                        turneth the sweet taste into bitter. </p>

                        Wax is whited after this manner. Take the whitest and purest Wax: which,
                        being cut into small peeces, put into an earthen vessell, and poure
                        Sea-water or Brine into it, as much as may suffice to boile it. And cast in
                        also a little Niter: all this set over a soft fire. When it hath boiled up
                        twice or thrice, lift the vessell from the fire, and, the wax being
                        presently cooled with cold water, take it out: and when you have scraped off
                        the drosse, if any such hang on, and put it into other Salt water, seeth it
                        againe. And having boiled up twice or thrice, as before, lift it from the
                        fire againe. And then take the bottom of an other earthen pot, or a little
                        round board with a handle in the middle like a Churn-staffe, but without
                        holes: and having first wetted the bottom of it in cold water, dip it into
                        the hot vessell, and assoone as this wet bottom toucheth the wax, pull it
                        out againe, and you shall have sticking to the bottom a thin cake: which
                        when you have taken off, wet the bottom againe, and dip it as before: and
                        thus do till you have taken up all the wax in cakes. These cakes hang in the
                        open aire upon a line drawne through them, so that they may not touch one an
                        other, besprinkling them with water in the Sun-shine untill they be white.
                        If any man would have wax whiter, let him boile it oftner, and do all other
                        things in like manner as before. </p>
