# This is a test

1. Bees were trained to fly into an arena with an LCD screen (gamma corrected) in the center of the arena 
1. In the arena they were trained to associate either blue or green colour (presented in the screen) with a high sucrose reward (50%) presented in a vial in the right or left side of the arena 
1. The opposite side contained a vial with  equal amount of water
1. The same bee was then trained to the second colour with a lower sucrose reward (30%) on the opposite side of the arena

1. The colour and sides were counterbalanced for reward conditions to avoid any bias
1. Once  the bees reach a learning criterion of 80% correct choices in the last 20 training they were tested
1. Three groups of bees were trained and tested to the trained colours and three intermediate colours in one of the below conditions

1. The three groups were, free-flying bees (control), bees shaken for 1 minute and bees which interacted with a shaken bee for 2 minutes
1. We looked at the optimistic choices, i.e. whether bees were going to the high reward side in the tests and coded it as 1 and 0 means they went to the low reward side
1. During tests, only water was provided in the vials on both sides
1. After each test the bee was given four refresher trainings (2 each of the different colour/reward combinations)
1. 12 bees 4 different colonies were used for the control and interaction experiments. 5 bees were tested so far for the ongoing  experiment with shaken bees
